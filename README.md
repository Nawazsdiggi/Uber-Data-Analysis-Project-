Uber Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Python and data visualization techniques. The primary goal is to clean and explore the dataset to understand ride frequency, peak hours, trip distribution, and more.

📌 Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data and visualize key insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🔍 What I Did in This Project
Loaded and explored a real-world Uber dataset.

Performed data cleaning:

Removed null/missing values.

Converted columns to appropriate datetime and categorical formats.

Conducted time-series and categorical analysis:

Extracted new time-based features like hour, day, weekday, and month.

Created multiple visualizations to identify:

Peak ride hours.

Most active days for Uber rides.

Frequency of rides by pickup point (Airport, City, Others).

Trip status distribution: Cancelled, Trip Completed, etc.

Identified operational patterns and insights to improve decision-making for Uber logistics.

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
Python 🐍

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – interactive data analysis

📈 Key Insights
Peak ride requests happen during morning (5–10 AM) and evening (5–9 PM) hours.

A high number of cancellations are observed during rush hours.

City pickups have higher ride counts compared to Airport pickups.

Demand is heavily skewed by time of day and pickup point location.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains ride request records including timestamps, pickup locations, and trip statuses.
